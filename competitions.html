<h1>Competitions</h1>
<p> Competition days are everything that a band works for! The band season runs from early May to late August. The first of the five Majors is the British Championships in Paisley, the last of the five majors ( and my favourite major) is the World Championships in Glasgow Green! For four of the Majors we usually stay in Scotland for 3 days at a time, but for Worlds we stay for a full week in the city! Being current World Drum Corp champions, and the band being ranked second in the world, we are asked to perform at many pipe band related events in Glagow City that week. 
<h2> Competition Day</h2>
<p> I am going to give you an example of the All Irelands that are going to be in Lisburn. Living in Dublin we will have to do a good bit of travelling, so I will have to get up at 7, so not too bad! I put on my uniform which does take around 10 minutes, the girls have to wear their hair off their face, either in a bun or very neat ponytail, I staraighten my hair put it in a high ponytail. I would have to be out of the house for 8 and would meet another girl in the tenor core 10 mins away and we would drive to the North, the other drummers carpool aswell because our drum corp consists of top drummers from 4 countries! We would be there at 11 ( 3 hours before we compete) we warm up and then compete in the MSR and Medley. We would finish up playing at around 2 and have to wait until 6 for the March past and results! We would go to a nearby hotel to celebrate then go home for some well earned rest!!
