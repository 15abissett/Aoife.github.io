<h1>Present day St Laurence O Toole Pipe Band</h1><p>I am very proud to say since the early 2000's O Toole's really have risen up the ranks! We compete in the highest grade (Grade 1). We are currently ranked 2nd in the world, and we were only 1 point away from 2nd! In 2010, the band held the Pre Worlds concert which is the biggest pipe band show on the calendar, it takes place in the Glagow concert hall, and is safe to say can just about hold the amount of people that come to the concert! in 2010 we won the Worlds in Grade 1- the first worlds ever won by the band! Since then the band have been consistently in the Top 3 at all 5 majors in Scotland and Nothern Ireland. In 2015 the band were 1 point away from winning the worlds again, however Shotts and Dykehead took the title after a great MSR performance. Pipe Major Alen Tully and Drum Sergeant Stephen Creighton lead the band and have made us all the players we are today! </p>
